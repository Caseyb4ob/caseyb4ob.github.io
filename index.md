I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Biomathematics at NCSU. I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 2021 with a BS in Mathematical Biology and Computational Biology and spent the following year working as a Bioinformatics Analyst at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Since starting my PhD in August of 2023, my research has focused on modeling genetic control measures for vector-borne diseases and agricultural pests using mathematical models. Most of my research focuses on developing gene drive, a powerful but controversial genetic tool with the power to control some disease vectors and pest populations. Their development will require active communication between impacted peoples, scientists, and policymakers. In addition to conducting my research, I also spend time designing and teaching a course about my research titled “Taming Selfish DNA” to undergraduates from different backgrounds.
